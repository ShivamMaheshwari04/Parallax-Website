# Parallax-Website
Parallax Website in HTML and CSS
This repository contains the code for a parallax website created in HTML and CSS. The website is not fully responsive, but it demonstrates my understanding of the transform and z-index CSS properties, as well as the concept of parallax scrolling.

The repository contains the following files:
parallax-website.html: The HTML file for the website.
style.css: The CSS file for the website.
images: A folder containing the images used in the website.
